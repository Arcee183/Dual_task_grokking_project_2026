# Dual_task_grokking_project_2026

## Overview  
This is the accompanying code for my blogpost : [insert link]. This code was itself adapted from the *Progress Measures for Grokking via Mechanistic Interpretability* research paper from Neel Nanda et al. The google colab research code can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Grokking_Demo.ipynb.  

## Getting Started  
To get started using this project, use the accompanying code in either jupyter notebook (with access to GPU) or google colab. You may then start training a model and generate your own data. This data can then be used further downstream to generate plots and perform mechanistic interpretability research. I have code examples for generating plots and doing the research. Feel free to modify the template once you have downloaded it from GitHub.

### Prerequisites  
There may be some specific prerequisites for numpy, kaleido and plotly. The current version of the notebook should run just fine (you do need to restart the session when running the first cell).
